There are two options for this flag fit and post . For estimating per-SNP posterior see here . --zscore1 specifies a text file containing a list of paths to GWAS summary statistics for population 1, one path per line. Typically, there should be one such text file for each chromosome. And each line in the text file corresponds to GWAS summary statistics of one region on that chromosome. See here for format of GWAS summary statistics data for PESCA. --zscore2 specifies a text file containing a list of paths to GWAS summary statistics for population 2, one path per line. Typically, there should be one such text file for each chromosome. And each line in the text file corresponds to GWAS summary statistics of one region on that chromosome. See here for format of GWAS summary statistics data for PESCA. --ld1 specifies a text file containing a list of paths to LD matrices for population 1, one path per line. Typically, there should be one such text file for each chromosome. And each line in the text file corresponds to LD matrix of one region on that chromosome. Additionally, each line in the text file should correspond to the same region listed by the --zscore1 flag. --ld2 specifies a text file containing a list of paths to LD matrices for population 2, one path per line. Typically, there should be one such text file for each chromosome. And each line in the text file corresponds to LD matrix of one region on that chromosome. Additionally, each line in the text file should correspond to the same region listed by the --zscore2 flag. --nburn specifies the number of burn-ins for the MCMC. The default is 5000. --nsample specifies the number of samples for the MCMC. The default is 5000. --sigmasq1 specifies genome-wide SNP-heritability (e.g. estimated by LDSC) for population 1 multiplied by sample size of the GWAS in population 1. --sigmasq2 specifies genome-wide SNP-heritability (e.g. estimated by LDSC) for population 2 multiplied by sample size of the GWAS in population 2. --totnsnp specifies total number of SNPs across all chromosomes. --max_iter specifies maximum number of EM iterations.
